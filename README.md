# WebQuickStart
Boilerplate for a simple web project structure - quickly test ideas and make stuff on the fly.

First make a new directory and grab the repo with 
```
mkdir MyProject && cd MyProject
git clone https://github.com/Grandclosing/WebQuickStart.git .
```

Then run 
```npm run save```

This will set up a handy alias for you for subsequent projects. The process would look like:

```
mkdir MyAwesomeProject && cd MyAwesomeProject
webqs
```
